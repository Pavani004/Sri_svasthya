## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - 📌 **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** – Probabilistic clustering for identifying health patterns.  
  - 📌 **Hierarchical Clustering** – Forms a hierarchy of similar health profiles.  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Workflow  

1️⃣ **Data Collection**: User inputs health parameters.  
2️⃣ **Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes data.  
3️⃣ **Model Training**:  
   - **GMM** identifies probabilistic health clusters.  
   - **Hierarchical Clustering** forms a hierarchy of similar profiles.  
4️⃣ **Health Segmentation**: Assigns the user to a specific health category.  
5️⃣ **Recommendation Engine**: Provides health advice based on clustering results.
